Welcome to my blog, where I'll be exploring the exciting world of AI and computational linguistics. My name is Christian, and I'm currently a data scientist at a large pharmaceutical company with over 5 years of experience in this field. I hold a BS in Biochemistry, an MS in Information Technology focusing on Data Analytics, and an MBA in International Business. A lot of my work over the past several years has been around leveraging the current state of the art in computational linguistics and helping apply it to different business problems.

Through this blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and practical applications of AI and computational linguistics. You'll find a wide range of topics covered here, including natural language processing, machine learning, and other related areas. I'll be sharing my thoughts and experience, as well as curating the latest news and developments in the field. Whether you're a data scientist, a student, or simply interested in AI and its applications, I hope to provide you with valuable information and thought-provoking content.
