## Introductions are in Order

Welcome to my new blog, where I'll be exploring the exciting world of AI and computational linguistics. My name is Christian, and I'm currently a data scientist at a large pharmaceutical company with over 5 years of experience in this field. I hold a BS in Biochemistry, an MS in Information Technology focusing on Data Analytics, and an MBA in International Business. A lot of my work over the past several years has been around leveraging the current state of the art in computational linguistics and helping apply it to different business problems.

Through this blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and practical applications of AI and computational linguistics. You'll find a wide range of topics covered here, including natural language processing, machine learning, and other related areas. I'll be sharing my thoughts and experience, as well as curating the latest news and developments in the field. Whether you're a data scientist, a student, or simply interested in AI and its applications, I hope to provide you with valuable information and thought-provoking content.

## Why Computational Linguistics

The current excitement and progress in AI and computational linguistics reminds me of the thrilling era of scientific discovery in the Victorian era. Just as scientists in the 19th century were able to make groundbreaking advancements in fields like physics, biology, and chemistry, we are now witnessing a similar level of innovation in the field of AI. The recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been particularly noteworthy, and have the potential to transform the way we interact with technology.

What's even more exciting is that, just as in the Victorian era, the latest advancements in AI are becoming more accessible to the general public. With all the public excitement and interest in LLMs thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT the community is seeing a diversity of ideas which will very likely continue to add to the momentum in the field. Additionally thanks to advancement in both inference and training techniques which run on consumer grade hardware, it’s possible for individuals and organizations to take advantage of the latest advancements in AI without needing expensive, specialized hardware. This is opening up a whole new world of possibilities for innovation and exploration.

Overall, I believe that the current excitement and progress in AI and computational linguistics, combined with the increasing accessibility of the field, is ushering in a new era of scientific discovery and innovation. Just as the Victorian era ushered in a new era of scientific progress and technological advancements, I believe that we are now on the cusp of a similar revolution.
